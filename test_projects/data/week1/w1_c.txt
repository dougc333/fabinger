1. The fundamental proble of Causal Inference is that:
We can only observer one potential outcome for each subject
treatment is typicall not randomly assigned
causal effects are only well defined by hypotheticla interventions
2. which of the following represents the causal effect of treatment on the treated?
E(Y^1|A=1)-E(Y^0|A=1)
E(Y^1|A=1)-E(Y^1|A=0)
E(Y|A=1)-E(Y|A=0)
E(Y^1)-E(Y^0)
3. which of the following represents the average causal effect for the population? 
E(Y|A=1)-E(Y|A=0)
E(Y^1)-E(Y^0)
E(Y^1|A=1)-E(Y^1|A=0)
E(Y^1|A=1)-E(Y^0|A=1)
4. Which assumption would be voilated if the effectiveness of treatment on an individual depended on the treatment status of other individuals?
Ignorability
Positiveiy
SUTVA
Consistency
5. Which assumption would be violated if we were intrested in the causal effect of treatment for people 40-80 but everyhone over age 70 received the treatment? 
Ignorability
SUTVA
Consistency
Postivity
6. If the consistency assumptoin holds, then the observed outcome for a treated subjecct is equal to their potential outcome under the treatment. 
False
True
7. Which of the following can most easily thought of as an intervention
changing blood pressure
within levels of X treatment assignment is independent from the potential outcomes
treatement assignemnent is independent from the observed outcomes given X
9. computing means within levels of covariates and then combining these estimates is known as 
calibration
factor analysis
standardization
